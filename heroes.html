					<h6>Outward appearance</h6>
					<br>
					<p>In the books, Hermione is described as having bushy brown hair and brown eyes. Her front teeth, already very large, grow uncontrollably in Goblet of Fire after she is affected by a spell cast by Draco. Madam Pomfrey attends to her in the hospital wing and, at her request, shrinks the teeth down to a normal size for her mouth.</p>
					<br>
					<h6>Personality</h6>
					<br>
					<p>Hermione's most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness. She is levelheaded, book-smart, and very logical. Throughout the series, Hermione uses the skills of a librarian to gather the information necessary to defeat Voldemort. When in doubt, it is to the library that Hermione turns.[36] She is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friendsâ€”a person who can be counted on. Rowling stated that Hermione is a person that, "never strays off the path; she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done."[37] Despite Hermione's intelligence and bossy attitude, Rowling says that Hermione has "quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality,"[38] as well as a "sense of insecurity underneath," feels, "utterly inadequate... and to compensate, she tries to be the best at everything at school, projecting a false confidence that can irritate people."[39] During her Defence against the Dark Arts exam at the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione reveals that her biggest fear is failure, after a Boggart takes the form of Professor McGonagall and tells her that she has failed all her exams.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Hermione is extremely compassionate and is quick to help others, especially those who are defenceless, such as Neville Longbottom, first-years, House-Elves, fellow Muggle-borns, half-giants like Hagrid, and werewolves like Lupin. It was revealed by Rowling after the publication of the final book that Hermione's career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione had looked in the Mirror of Erised, she would have seen Harry, Ron, and herself "alive and unscathed, and Voldemort finished."[40] Hermione has also learned to ignore what bullies such as Draco say to her, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born witch, and states in Deathly Hallows that she is "a Mudblood and proud of it".</p>
					<br>
					<h6>Magical abilities and skills</h6>
					<br>
					<p>Hermione is portrayed during the whole series as an exceptionally talented young witch. Rowling has stated that Hermione is a "borderline genius."[42] She received ten O.W.L.s, which were nine Outstandings and one Exceeds Expectations. She is the best student in Harry's year and is repeatedly the first student to master any spell or charm introduced in classes and even from more advanced years, as evidenced when she is able to conjure a Protean Charm on the D.A.'s fake Galleon coins, which is actually a N.E.W.T. level charm.[43] She is also the first one to be able to cast non-verbal spells.[44] Hermione is a competent duellist - Rowling has stated that while during the first three books Hermione would have beaten Harry in a magical duel, by the fourth book Harry had become so good at Defence Against the Dark Arts that he would have defeated Hermione.[45] Hermione did not tend to do as well in subjects that were not learned through books or formal training, as broom flying did not come as naturally to her in her first year as it did to Harry,[46] and she showed no affinity for Divination, which she dropped from her third year studies.[47][48] She was also not good at Wizard's Chess, as it was the only thing at which she ever lost.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Hermione's Patronus is an otter, Rowling's favourite animal. In the Deathly Hallows book, while they enter the Ministry Of Magic under disguise, Hermione impersonates Mafalda Hopkirk. It is also stated that conjuring a Patronus is the only thing she ever has trouble with.[50] Her wand is made of vine wood and dragon heartstring core; vine is the wood ascribed to Hermione's fictional birth month (September) on the Celtic calendar.</p>
